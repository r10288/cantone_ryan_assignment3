<p>For project 3 I chose to continue my adventure story from last week with our hero finding a dragon slayer named Spartan.  He is a daring knight who fights 3 different types of dragons.  Spartan is going to stock up on pizza rolls and monster then challenge all 3 dragon types at once!  He is a true hero of the land!!!</p>
<p>I think my JSON coding is wrong I was slightly confused by this and not sure I did it right.  Please let me know in the comments below thanks class!</p>
